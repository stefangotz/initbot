# Initbot

Discord bot that manages RPG character initiatives

## Discord

The bot understands a few commands.
These can be sent in any channel the bot user is a member of or as DMs.
Simply type `$help` to see what the bot can do for you.

### Initiative

The typical flow during a game session is:

1. The Judge declares initiative to be rolled
2. Player A rolls an initiative value of 10 and types `$init Alfalfa 10` to create their character *Alfalfa* (if it doesn't exist yet) and set their initiative to 10.
3. All other players do the same for their characters and the Judge for all NPCs.
4. The Judge types `$inis` to obtain all characters and NPCs in initiative order.
5. Departed characters and NPCs can be removed with, e.g., `$remove Alfalfa` at any time.

Note that anyone (i.e., any Discord user on a given server) can update the initiative of or remove the character of any other player.

Get more information on any of the commands with `$help`, e.g., `$help init`.
